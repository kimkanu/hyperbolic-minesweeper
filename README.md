# Hyperbolic Minesweeper (WIP)

## TODO

- Find a efficient and robust way to generate tiling
  + Now it is quite accurate, but it needs more speedy calculations. Maybe WASM and workers will help this.
- Implement logic of minesweeper
- Add documentation (hopefully with some figures to describe how the renderer of the Poincare disk model is implemented)
